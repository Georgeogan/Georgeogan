## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
I am Ogan Victor, a BSc graduate in Biochemistry who has recently shifted my career focus towards Data Analysis. My passion for data-driven decision-making has led me to immerse myself in learning tools like SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I am excited to continue growing in this field and contributing to meaningful projects.
